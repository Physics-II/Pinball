###Commands
- Left/right arrows - flippers
- Down arrow - load spring to launch ball
- F1 - debug mode, mouse joint can be used to test features
- B - when won/lost, starts a new game (saves the highscore)

###Features
- Enemies swamp frogs and fairies (small eye-like creatures were not implemented)
- Boss (KING FROG!!!)
- Missions (ten of them, the conditions to pass each one and thus get to the boss are shown
at the top of the window, along with score and highscore)
- Bouncers (beware, they... bounce a lot.)
- Ufo/spaceship/mothership thing (blocks the ball and launches it back to the left of right)

####NOTE TO RIC: coins were not implemented, along with some minor light animations, although there is indeed a score, that can be gained by killing scary monsters.
